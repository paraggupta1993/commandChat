Command Chat :

Its a command-line based chat system, based on BSD sockets and POSIX threads coded in C++. Both source code and executable are included.

1. Compilation on a linux machine using GCC compiler version 4.5.2 :
(same commands may run for different versions as well )

a. command to check GCC version 

$ g++ -v


b. Compile "server.cpp":

$ g++ server.cpp -lpthread -o server 

This should be run on one of the machines that want to talk. It will produce an executable called "server".

b. Compile "client.cpp" :

Open client.cpp in any text editor like 'vim'.
Replace address "10.1.34.29" with the server's IP address ( IP address of the other machine you want to talk with )

You can get the ip adress of a linux machine by : 

$ ifconfig

Save the file and then run the following command to compile it.

$ g++ client.cpp -lpthread -o client

This should be run on the other machine than the server. It will produce and executable called client.

Now both machine are ready to run the executables and talk.

Run server on one machine using :

$ ./server

Run client on other machine using :

$ ./client

By default both server and client will communicate via port 5000

if you want to communicate over say port 'X' then do the following:

$ ./server X

Run client on other machine using :

$ ./client X
